              <p>
                I'm probably not the right guy, probably not the right time... I
                met you in the most random way possible, that's how I met your
                mom and in the same way several situations we shared happened,
                for example: John and Liz in Santa Rosa.
              </p>
              <p>
                I can't lie and say that I understand the reasons why today you
                don't want to continue with us, because it is very difficult to
                understand something when there is no reason, you didn't give me
                one, however, I can promise you that, even if I don't
                understand, with time I will assimilate the fact that you have
                made this decision and thus, I will be able to offer you the
                friendship you expect from me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just as the events between us have been random, I feel that you
                are the most random person I have ever met in my life, you are
                very unique, you are very special, you are wonderful... I never
                knew what to expect from you, and I deeply regret not having
                transmitted to you the security that I would have wished to
                transmit to you. Maybe it is the fact that I am several years
                older than you, maybe it is the fact that you are leaving and
                you don't want to feel any commitment, in spite of everything I
                never wanted to make you feel that you had to commit yourself in
                any way to me, I only wanted to transmit you that my feelings
                towards you were sincere and respectful.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am writing all this to you because I know what the time you
                have asked me for means, I know how it is going to end, and
                believe me it was not what I preferred. I respect and accept
                your decision and everything that comes from you to me..... I
                wish I was the right one and that it was the right time... for
                me there are no barriers between you and me, except you.
